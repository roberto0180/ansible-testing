# This file is used to add, remove, edit client-ssl profile configuration on the load balancer.
# The information required for each client-ssl profile is cssl_pr_name, cssl_pr_parent_pr, cssl_pr_ciphers, and cssl_pr_state
# If you want to use the default Ansible variables for any of these values, then just use "" as the value. However a unique cssl_pr_name must be provided.
# The cssl_pr_state value can either be present or absent. When present, ensures that the profile exists. When absent, ensures the profile is removed.
# More info can be found here: https://clouddocs.f5.com/products/orchestration/ansible/devel/modules/bigip_profile_client_ssl_module.html
