# This file is used to add, remove, edit pool configuration on the load balancer.
# The information required for each pool is pl_name, pl_monitor, pl_members_port and pl_members_node (not that this is a list of nodes).
# If you want to use the default Ansible variables for any of these values, then just use "" as the value. However a unique pl_name must be provided.
# The pl_state value can either be present or absent. If absent, delete the pool if it exists and not assigned to a virtual server. If present, creates the pool and checks configuration is correct.
# More info can be found: https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/2.6/modules/bigip_pool_module.html
